## Development:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node, Express

This web application pulls data provided from an open-source API, and displays the data dynamically with the EJS templating language based on different button inputs.

This is the second half of a larger project surrounding teas. First an API was made to respond with simple information about teas, allowing anyone to use the data that is collected and formatted. This application takes that information and displays it dynamically with EJS in an easy to see and use layout using a carousel animation that I built using CSS and Javascript.

## Experience:
With EJS, or other templating languages, much can be done that allows for easy modification and quick building, and can be very powerful. The data being sent is of varying lenghts, so I had used two different loops within the EJS file, an object loop as well as a basic for-loop. The for-loop allowed me to create individual ID's for each tea-box rendered onto the page, allowing for specific and individual modification of each box.
