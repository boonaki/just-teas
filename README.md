# Tea Database App
This fullstack web application pulls data provided from an open-source API I developed, and displays the data dynamically with the EJS templating language based on different button inputs.

## Development:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node, Express

This project is the second half of a larger project surrounding teas. First an API was made to respond with simple information about teas, allowing anyone to use the data that I mnanually collected and formatted. This application takes that information and displays it dynamically with EJS in an easy to see and use layout using a carousel animation that I built using CSS and Javascript.

## Experience:
With EJS, or other templating languages, much can be done that allows for easy modification and quick building, and can be very powerful. Although unneccessary, I had used two different loops within the EJS to give other users of the API a clearer idea of how the data is being sent and the format of the data itself. This allowed me to create individual ID's for every box that was rendered onto the page, allowing for very specific modification of the tea-boxes being rendered.
